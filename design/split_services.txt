- mqtt client id should be the pod name??
- pass in the mqtt client id into mqtt code instead of pulling it from the config
- move jwt generator config outside of mqtt code
- move all of the mqtt broker config outside of mqtt code??

- platform.cloud-connector.rhc-message-ingress

- message format
  
  - message key - rhc_client_id (from topic)

    - Use the client id as the message key.  All messages with the same key,
      get sent to the same partitions.  This is important so that the ordering
      of the messages is retained.


  - kafka headers
    - topic
    - mqtt message id

  - message - json encoded message
