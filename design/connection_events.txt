Created event
The created event is produced any time a new host record is created.

{
   "type": "created",
   "rhc_client_id": "<id>",
   "account": "<account_number>",
   "dispatchers": {}
   "timestamp": "<create timestamp>"
}
type: identifies the type of the event


Updated event
The updated event is produced any time changes are made to an existing host record.

{
   "type": "updated",
   "rhc_client_id": "<id>",
   "account": "<account_number>",
   "dispatchers": {},
   "timestamp": "<update timestamp>"
}

The full representation of the updated connection (even fields that did not change) is always sent. 
The format is identical to the created event. The only difference is the event type.

Delete event
The delete event is produced when a host record is removed from HBI.

{
  "type": "deleted",
  "rhc_client_id": "<host id>",
  "account": "<account number>",
  "timestamp": "<delete timestamp>",
}

type: identifies the event type
timestamp: the time at which the host was deleted
account: the account number associated with the host that was deleted
